                        Metaupload&trade; is an anonymous, fully <strong>decentralized</strong>, file sharing service based on IPFS. All files are hashed and encrypted on upload an a decryption key is needed to acces those files again.

                        IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accesing files in a p2p enviroment. <br />
                        What that means is that IPFS makes it <strong>harder to censor</strong> content and supports a <strong>resilient internet</strong>.

                        After seeing the way many internet companies are acting nowadays, it's clear that we're moving towards a fully censored society with no <strong>free speech</strong>, and new technologies like blockchain and IPFS can and will contribute to mitigate that.
