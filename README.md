### THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT

This is a proof of concept. It's not recommended for production use and security hasn't been audited.

### How it works

Metaupload™ works like a classic p2p file sharing software, that means you run a instance of this page in your computer in order to "seed" the contents to other users. The content will be available as long as it stays on someones computer and that computer is connected to the internet and running an instance of Metaupload™.

The content upload will be encrypted and thus it will be accesible only to others with the encryption key.

### To Do
- [ ] Optimize encryption / decryption of large files
- [ ] Allow folder sharing
- [ ] Add a file manager, maybe?
